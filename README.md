Uses weather Api to display current forecast of specified city -weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Allows to preview 5-day forecast. Searched cities are stored in search history.


## Description
The motivation behind building this project was for the purpose of using a third party API, obtaining specific data provided by the API fetch and integrating it into the application. I built this project so that I may be able to view the current weather and up to a five day projection of the specified city. The problem that this project solves is that you can have a display of the weather for cities and with the use of local storage, conviniently searching for cities already visited. I learned the importance of understanding the data structure of the fetched api in order to obtain it correctly.
